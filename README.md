# Expo-StickerSmash

 In this tutorial, we'll create a universal app that runs on Android, iOS, and the web; all with a single codebase. Let's get started!

About this tutorial
The objective of this tutorial is to get started with Expo and become familiar with the Expo SDK. It'll cover the following topics:

Create an Expo App
Break down the app layout and implement it with flexbox
Use each platform's system UI to select an image from the media library
Create a sticker modal using the <Modal> and <FlatList> components from React Native
Add touch gestures to interact with a sticker
Use third-party libraries to capture a screenshot and save it to the disk
Handle platform differences between Android, iOS, and web
Finally, go through the process of configuring a status bar, a splash screen, and an icon to complete the app
